From a young age computers and everything related to them have been my passion. To turn my passion into a proffesion I am pursuing my Computer Science degree at Rensselaer Polytechnic Instute. I have many interests, Data Science, Quantitive Analysis, Quantitive Development, Machine Learning, Software Development, Full Stack Web Development and more as I go along my journey. Besides my technical interests, I like to swim for fun, play video games and visit new places in my area.

I'm currently working on [Discord Betting Bot](https://github.com/enisaras/SportsBettingBot) and [The Archives, the better Star Wars API](https://github.com/enisaras/The-Archives) and contributing to [CodeTheasarus](https://github.com/codethesaurus/codethesaur.us)
